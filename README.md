# Agon-Light-Experiments
Test code that MAY NOT WORK for others to read and provide advice.
I will update the status in the code comments that will indicate when something is working.
Yes I have written assembly and C for a long time, No I'm not an expert.
My limited knowledge + ChatGPT + Help from actual experts.
I'm very good at writing code the compiles and doesn't work, ChatGPT now speeds up that process ðŸ˜›

Goals
- Successfully get a fabGL command to the ESP32 under CP/M using
  - Z80 assembly
  - eZ80 assembly
  - Standard C
- Comms using SPI to and external device
  - Z80 assembly
  - eZ80 assembly
  - Standard C

Final goal
- EVERY fabGL command (even the esoteric ones, someone may find a novel use) written in Z80, eZ80 and Standard C running under MOS and CP/M
